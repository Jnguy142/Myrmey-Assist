# Search

The Search component is a component that renders a search form that resembles the WebSoc search form. The form manages its own
state and on search runs a prop function passing in all the search parameters.

## Props
- isSearching {boolean}
Whether or not a search is currently in progress, this will ensure the search button shows a loading sign and no further
searches can be made unless isSearching is false.

- onSearch {function(object)}
A function that is called when a search is initiated, it will be passed the search object as a parameter.

## Example
return (
    <Search isSearching={false} onSearch={(search) =>{console.log(search)}} />
)
