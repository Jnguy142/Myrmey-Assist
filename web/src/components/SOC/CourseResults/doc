# CourseResults

The CourseResults component is a component that renders a panel with the header being the course tag and name and the body being
all the offerings of the course. This component is relatable to a course's results on the UCI WebSoc. Note however this only displays a box
for one course and its offerings, so this component is a subcomponent of SearchResults where that component receives all the results of a search
and uses this component to render each individual course and its offerings.

## Props
- courseResults {object}
The course results object to render, should contain the keys: ['dept','num','name','offerings'].

- addPlannedCourse {function(object)}
A function that is called when a user wants to add a course offering to their planned list, it will be passed the course object as a parameter.
