# PreReqs

The PreReqs component is a component that displays the prereqs of a course as well as wether or not the provided
list of courses taken satisfies the prereqs. Currently prereqs are viewed in "sections" so if a course's prereqs are as follows:
(A1 or A2 or A3) and (B1) and (C1 or C2) there are three sections, the As, Bs and Cs. It can be viewed that only 1 course in each section has
to have been taken in order for that entire section to be satisfied, for example a student can take any one of the A classes to satisfy that
entire section. The PreReqs component displays the Prerequisites title along with a red/green tag depending on if all the sections are satisfied
and then right below has s columns where s is the number of sections and each column has c rows where c is the number of courses in that section. 
Along with the course names there will be a green checkmark or red 'X' which represents whether or not that course has been taken, so in order
for the prereqs to be met, there has to be at least one green checkmark in every column. 

## Props
- prereqs {[[string]]}
A 2D array of course names, where each index in the main array represents a section and each array within that index represents the courses
in that section. So a prereq that looks like this: (A1 or A2 or A3) and (B1) and (C1 or C2) would look like:
[
    ['A1','A2','A3'],
    ['B1'],
    ['C1','C2']
]

- coursesTaken {object}
The courses a student has taken as an object where the keys are the course's names. This would usually just be the student's completedCourses 
assigned to their inProgress courses.

-openCourseDetails {function(string)}
A function that can be executed to open the details of a prereq course.

## Example
let prereqs = [
    [
        "A1",
        "A2",
        "A3"
    ],
    [
        'B1'
    ],
    [
        'C1',
        'C2'
    ]
];
 
let coursesTaken = {
    'A3': true,
    'C1': true
}

return (
    <PreReqs prereqs={prereqs} coursesTaken={coursesTaken} />
);

This will display something along the lines of:

Prerequisites (Not Satisfied)

|A1|X|  |B1|X|  |C1|✔|
|A2|X|          |C2|X|
|A3|✔|
