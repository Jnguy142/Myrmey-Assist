# PreReqsSection

The PreReqsSection component is a sub-component of PreReqs the main purpose of this component is to display one specific section of prereqs.
So if the main PreReqs component gets the following prereqs (A1 or A2 or A3) and (B1) and (C1 or C2) this component will only render one column
be it A1,A2,A3 or B1 or C1,C2. The component puts the course names and whether or not they are satisfied in a table where each row is a course 
along with a check if it was satisfied or not.

## Props
- section {[object]]}
An array of objects with 2 keys: name and satisfied.

-openCourseDetails {function(string)}
A function that can be executed to open the details of a prereq course.

## Example
let section = [
    {
        name: 'C1',
        satisfied: true 
    },
    {
        name: 'C2',
        satisfied: false
    }
]

return (
    <PreReqsSection section={section} />
);

This will return something along the lines of:

|C1|âœ”|
|C2|X|
