# GradeDistribution

The GradeDistribution component is a component that renders a table showing Instructor's and their grade distribution.
The component expects the grades to already be pulled as well as the instructor object, it merely renders the information.

## Props
- grades {[object]}
An array where each index represents a professor and their grade distribution. The object should contain the following keys:
    - instructor {object}
        An instructor object which has 2 keys, an optional `id` which is the professor's ratemyproffesor id and a mandatory `name` key.
    - A,B,C,D,F {number}
        Key is the grade and the value is the number of students who received that grade.

## Example
<GradeDistribution grades={[
                {
                    instructor: {
                        id: 59341,
                        name: 'DILLENCOURT, M.'
                    },
                    F: 1,
                    D: 0,
                    C: 0,
                    B: 0,
                    A: 0
                },
                {
                    instructor: {
                        name: 'KLEFSTAD, R.'
                    },
                    F: 0,
                    D: 0,
                    C: 0,
                    B: 0,
                    A: 1
                }
            ]} />

This example will render a table with 2 rows, one row will be for Dillencourt and one for Klefstad. Since an id was provided
for Dillencourt, his name will be a hyperlink that when clicked will open up their ratemyprofessor in a new tab.
